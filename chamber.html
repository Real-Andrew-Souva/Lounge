        <p>
            Here are a few tips to help you better enjoy your stay in Webville.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Always dress in layers and keep an html around your
            head and body.</li>
            <li>Get plenty of rest while you're here, sleep helps all
            those rules sink in.</li>
            <li> Don't miss the work of our local artists right downtown
            in the CSS gallery</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>
            Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook
            at precisely 88mph the instant the lightning strikes the tower...
            everything will be fine.
